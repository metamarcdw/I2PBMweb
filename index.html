<h1>PyBitmessage-I2P</h1>
<p>This is a fork of PyBitmessage that runs natively over I2P (ONLY) It requires a running I2P router with SAM Bridge activated.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE: A Windows binary has been created using PyInstaller. It has been tested and is working under Windows 8.1. It is available from the GitHub repository at:</strong><br />

<h3>Differences from vanilla Bitmessage</h3>
<p>PyBitmessage-I2P has several important differences from vanilla Bitmessage. Always remember THIS IS A SEPARATE NETWORK! PyBitmessage-I2P forms a completely new and separate Bitmessage network inside of I2P. Since this is a new network, the client must bootstrap by accessing an eepsite and reading a list of known nodes. This bootstrapping process can cause delays if your I2P router is not well integrated with the I2P network. Another important difference to take note of is that the format for Bitmessage addresses has been changed slightly to signify that you are seeing a BM-I2P address rather than a vanilla address. PyBitmessage-I2P addresses start with "BM+" rather than "BM-".</p>
<p>If you would like to contribute to the network by running a node 24/7 for newcomers to bootstrap from, navigate to your Network Settings dialog and send a copy of your I2P destination string to:<br />
